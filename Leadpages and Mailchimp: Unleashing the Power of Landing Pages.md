### LeadBoxes: Capturing Leads Everywhere

One standout feature of Leadpages is **LeadBoxes**, which allows you to add pop-ups to virtually any digital asset, including blogs and personal websites. These pop-ups are customizable and can be triggered by clicks on buttons, text, or images, or even set on timers to engage users at just the right moment.

The **Exit LeadBox** is particularly powerful. When a visitor is about to leave your site, this feature presents a compelling offer to keep them engaged, boosting your chances of converting traffic into leads.

### Native Ad Creation

Leadpages takes the guesswork out of ad creation with its ability to generate Facebook and Instagram ads directly within the platform. It pulls content from your landing page and uses it to create visually appealing, high-converting ads. This integration not only saves time but also maximizes your ad spend by automatically adding a Facebook pixel for retargeting and analytics.

### Split Testing

Testing variations of your landing page is crucial for improving conversions. Leadpages' built-in **split testing** feature allows you to compare different versions of your landing pages side-by-side. By analyzing conversion rates, you can determine whatâ€™s working best and refine your marketing strategy.

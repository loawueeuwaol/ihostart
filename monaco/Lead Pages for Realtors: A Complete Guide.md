## Why Realtors Should Use Leadpages

While Leadpages is widely recognized as a landing page builder, its extensive features make it much more than that. Itâ€™s a powerful marketing tool designed to elevate your online business to new heights.

### Key Features for Realtors

#### 1. Professionally Designed Templates
Leadpages offers a library of tested, high-converting templates tailored to help you bring in more leads and reduce wasted clicks.

#### 2. LeadBoxes for Better Conversions
One standout feature of Leadpages is **LeadBoxes**, which are customizable pop-ups that can be placed almost anywhere on your website or digital assets. These pop-ups can:

- Trigger based on user actions, such as clicks on buttons or images.
- Be scheduled with timers, displaying a pop-up after a visitor has spent a certain amount of time on your site.
- Include Exit Intent LeadBoxes, which appear when visitors are about to leave the page, helping to retain potential leads with compelling offers.

#### 3. Native Ad Creation for Facebook & Instagram
Leadpages allows you to create Facebook and Instagram ads directly within the platform. This feature saves time and optimizes ad spending by automatically pulling content from your landing page to create an engaging advertisement. Additionally, Leadpages integrates with Facebook Pixel, enabling you to track, retarget, and analyze your ad performance seamlessly.

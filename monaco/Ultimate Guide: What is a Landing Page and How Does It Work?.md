## What Is a Landing Page?

A **landing page** is a single webpage designed with a clear focus‚Äîto guide visitors toward taking one specific action. Whether it‚Äôs collecting email addresses via an opt-in form or driving users to click a call-to-action (CTA) button, every element on the page serves a specific purpose.

### Landing Page vs. Website

Unlike a website, which typically includes multiple navigation options and pathways, a landing page has one ultimate goal. It‚Äôs intentionally designed without distractions like headers or footers, so visitors are funneled toward completing the desired action, such as subscribing to a list or making a purchase.

## Types of Landing Pages

### 1. **Lead Generation Landing Pages**
These pages are designed to collect visitor information, such as names and email addresses, in exchange for something valuable, like a free eBook, checklist, or webinar.

Example: A lead generation landing page promoting a **FREE Facebook groups spreadsheet for bloggers**. The only action visitors can take is clicking the CTA button to submit their details.

### 2. **Click-Through Landing Pages**
These pages provide information about a product or service to encourage users to click through to a checkout or sales page.

## What is Leadpages?

Leadpages is a feature-rich landing page creator that simplifies lead generation and conversion optimization. Founded by Clay Collins in 2012, this U.S.-based platform was later acquired by Redbrik, a digital properties company.

Marketers can design landing pages quickly, using templates or starting from scratch, without any coding experience. Recently, Leadpages introduced a website builder, expanding its capabilities to help users create full-fledged websites, alert bars, and pop-ups with ease.

### Key Highlights of Leadpages
